# Show Latest Threads

Keep the sidebar to what you are working on now. Show Latest Threads is a
thread list that can hide every thread and project with no activity in the
last 24, 48 or 72 hours.

## What you get

- A **Recent only** switch and a **24h / 48h / 72h** picker at the top of the
  list. Turn the switch off to see everything.
- Pinned threads on top, then your sections, then projects ordered by their
  latest activity.
- Child threads stay under their parent. A recent child keeps its parent in
  the list, so the tree never breaks.
- The open thread and any thread that is running or waiting for your answer
  stay visible whatever their age.
- Status on the right of every row, as in BB's own list: a dot for unread,
  a spinner while the agent works, a question mark when it waits for your
  answer, a red cross after a failure, a clock for a queued message, a pencil
  for an unsent draft.
- Opening a thread counts as activity for the filter.
- With the filter off, every project is listed, even one without threads.
- English and Russian. By default the plugin follows your computer's language.

## Settings

Settings > Plugins > Show Latest Threads holds the filter, the window and the
language (System, English, Русский).

## How it works

The list reads the same live thread data as BB's own sidebar and acts through
BB's own commands, so pin, rename, archive and delete behave as usual. Nothing
leaves your machine and the plugin needs no account.

If the list does not appear after install, pick it under Settings >
Appearance > Sidebar.

## Install

In BB: Plugins > Browse > Show Latest Threads > Install. From a shell:

```sh
